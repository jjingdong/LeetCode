201.Â Bitwise AND of Numbers Range
Medium

Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.
Example 1:
Input: [5,7]
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: [0,1]
Output: 0

class Solution:

    # E.g.
    # 0 = 0
    # 1 = 1
    # 0 and 1 = 1
    #
    # E.g
    # 5 = 101
    # 6 = 110
    # 7 = 111
    # 101 and 110 and 111 = 100 = 4
    # common prefix
    # common prefix of start and end
    #
    # Solution I: bit shift
    #
    # Solution II: Brian Kernighan's algorithm
    # num and (num-1) ---> the rightmost bit of one of num would be turned off

    # Time O(1) Space O(1)
