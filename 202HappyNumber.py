# 202.Â Happy Number
# Easy
#
# Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
# A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer,
# replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the
# number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include
# 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
# Example:Â 
# Input: 19
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# 1^2 + 9^2 = 82
# 8^2 + 2^2 = 68
# 6^2 + 8^2 = 100
# 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
